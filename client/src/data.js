        text: 'Colors play a crucial role in interior design and are always important to the current interior design trends. They can make or break your designs, as colors evoke emotions from the people who will exist in your space. In order to design in accordance with the latest trends, colors should match the look, design, and feel of the house. In earlier seasons, warm colors had been traded in for cooler colors like purple. However, in 2021, warm colors are making a huge comeback. While red is being considered the color of the season, all shades of reds, orange and tangerine will be taking over the trends of 2021. Browns and beiges are more common for the earthy tones in homes this year. Although last year, grey was mostly used as a neutral color, beige and the warm color palette are replacing the cool hues this season.'

Earlier, this element was used only as an interesting twist, but now it’s bolder and more decorative. The latest interior design trends are seeing wallpaper as a type of art for your surroundings. Geometric patterns, landscape scenery, abstract shapes, human and animal figures – many types of wallpaper prints will help you embrace the interior design trends of 2021.'

        text: 'Interior design trends seem to be taking a more eco-friendly approach as people are moving towards warm tones and natural elements. Decor elements made either from real or faux natural materials are in high demand, as they add a natural and authentic look to your space. The latest trends incorporate natural wood everywhere, from flooring, to countertops, to accent decor, to cabinets. Stones like marble, granite, and pebble – as well as materials resembling these stones – also address this current interior design trend. Both consumers and designers are embracing recycled and handcrafted goods not just for their aesthetic appeal, but also as a sign of their eco-friendly design approach. Whether you use a sustainable bamboo floor or a garden of indoor plants, bringing nature indoors is one of the hottest interior design trends for 2021.'
